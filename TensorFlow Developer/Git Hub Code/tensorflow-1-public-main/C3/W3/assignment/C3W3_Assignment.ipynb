    "Welcome to this assignment! During this week you saw different ways to handle sequence-like data. You saw how some Keras' layers such as `GRU`, `Conv` and `LSTM` can be used to tackle problems in this space. Now you will put this knowledge into practice by creating a model architecture that does not overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will be using a variation of the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/sentiment140), which contains 1.6 million tweets alongside their respective sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive). **This variation contains only 160 thousand tweets.**\n",
    "\n",

    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",
    "- Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.\n",
